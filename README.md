## This repository contains Python and Matlab scripts and data used to generate the figures presented in the paper "*title to be added when finalized*"

### 1. Scripts
- SNM_Fig1allFig2profiles.py:
  This Python script contains the code used to generate Figure 1a-d (presenting results from the virtual chemostat model), and Figure 2a-d (presenting depth profiles from ROMS and observations).
- Sun_et_al_ROMS_figures.m:
  This Matlab script contains the MATLAB code used to generate Figure 2e&f
  ROMS output can be found in 'data/', with additional functions in 'scripts/'
  

### 2. Data files
- output0D (results from the virtual chemostat model)
- output0D_withoutNOB (results from the virtual chemostat model excluding NOB)
- nitrox_20years (results from ROMS)
- ObsConcentrations (measured concentrations from published studies: Tracey et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2023)
- ObsRates (measured concentrations from published studies: Tracey et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2023)
